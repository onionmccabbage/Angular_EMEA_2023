Angular
=======
In a terminal window, do this ONCE to install Angular command-line-interface (cli):
    npm install -g @angular/cli
Then you can use cli instructions and Angular will know what to do
To create a new Angular project:
   ng new first-proj  
   (it offers some choices, this time say 'No' to routing and accept the others)
Then watch as Angular downloads a bunch of stuff into a folder called 'first-proj'
It might take a good while, but when it's finished, change directory into your new project:
    cd first-proj   
There will be a load of assets in 'node_modules'
Your work will go in 'src/app'
Then get your new project running in development mode:
    ng serve  
This is a 'watching server' so any changes to your code are reflected in the browser.
By default it's always localhost:4200
From here on, your workflow is: make code edits, see results in browser, repeat
The default Angular application includes links to documentation, DevTools and some cli statements

Points to note: 
- Angular uses 'TypeScript' rather than 'ECMAScript'
- You can mostly ignore this fact, except in a few specific cases
- e.g. using Angular events. We will deal with when we get to it
