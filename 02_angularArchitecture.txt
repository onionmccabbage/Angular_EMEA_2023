Angular Architecture
====================
Every Angular project is structured in a similar way
Important files are:
- main.ts (leave well alone)
- index.html (not much to see here)
Most of what you work on will be in first-proj/src
- In the 'src/app' folder you find:
    - app.module.ts (we do some configuration in here later)
    - All your app lives inside app.component (.css .html .ts and .spec.ts)
      ( .ts is for the ECMAScript .html is the template ) 
Try this: 
- delete EVERYTHING inside app.component.html
- Then write some new template content, e.g.
            <article>
                <section>
                    <h2>Angular</h2>
                </section>
            </article>
- The browser now shows just your new template content
- That's why you need to know about HTML (and CSS)
