Angular Routing
===============
Routing means showing mutually exclusive content within the SPA
Typically users click links to show different content

Start a project that will include routing:
- ng new routed-proj
- select 'y' when asked about routing
- select defaults for all other options
Take a look at the new project stucture:
- you have an additional file called app-routing-module.ts
- inside NgModule you see an import for the routing module

To make routing work you need:
- <router-outlet> where the routed content will appear
- An array of routes inside app-routing-module
- Some <a> tags so users can choose routes
